# ✈️ Airline Management System  

This project is a **Python-based Airline Management System** that allows users to:  
✅ **View flight schedules**  
✅ **Book seats on flights**  
✅ **Optimize flight scheduling** using sorting algorithms  

## 🔹 Features  
- **Generate Random Flights** – Each flight has a unique ID, departure time, duration, and available seats.  
- **Sorting Algorithms for Scheduling** – Flights are sorted using **Merge Sort & Quick Sort**.  
- **Efficient Job Scheduling** – Prioritizes long-duration flights for better scheduling.  
- **Seat Booking System** – Users can **book seats on available flights**.  
- **User-Friendly CLI** – Simple command-line interface for easy interaction.

## 🔹 Technologies Used  
- **Python (Object-Oriented Programming)**  
- **Sorting Algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort)**  
- **Job Scheduling Algorithm**  
- **Random Data Generation (Simulated Flight Data)**

## 🔹 How to Run  
### 1️⃣ Install Python (if not already installed)  
   ```bash
   python --version  # Ensure Python 3.x is installed
   ```

### 2️⃣ Run the Script  
   ```bash
   python airline_management.py
   ```

### 3️⃣ Interact with the CLI  
#### Sample Menu:  
```
1. Display Flight Schedule  
2. Book a Flight  
3. Exit  
Enter your choice (1/2/3):  
```

#### Sample Output:  
```
Flight Schedule:  
Flight 1: Departure Time 10, Duration 3 hours, Available Seats 120  
Flight 2: Departure Time 14, Duration 5 hours, Available Seats 95  
...  
Enter the Flight ID you want to book: 2  
✅ Seat booked for Flight 2!  
```
